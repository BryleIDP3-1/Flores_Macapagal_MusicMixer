# The Quatro Music Mixer :orange:
This repository demonstrates collaborative work to create a multimedia application known as a music mixer using design and motion tools as well as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We based this project of our Final Integrated Project regarding the brand redesign. Since our chosen brand is Quatro, all elements of the music mixer is themed off that. Thanks for stopping by!
